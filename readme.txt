== Description ==

Displays a beautiful image gallery in pages or posts.
Just insert the `[gallery]` shortcode into your page or post, and any attached images will appear in the gallery.
It uses the awesome Galleria JavaScript image gallery framework, and it's easy to customize the display if you have JavaScript and CSS skills.
It's mobile- and touch-ready so you can easily swipe through your photos on supported devices.

This plugin relies on the built-in gallery functionality of WordPress.
Any images that are uploaded to (AKA attached) to a post or page will be pulled into this gallery.
In newer versions of WordPress you're able to add and remove images from a gallery, and even put them in a certain order.
For older versions of WP, you can specify the `ids` option in the shortcode in order to exclude and sort your images.
Here's an example of a shortcode with specified image IDs:

`[gallery ids="5,4,6,7"]`

== Installation ==

1. Upload Galleria to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place the [gallery] shortcode in your pages or posts.
